# Author a policy repository

Create a GitHub repository with bundles directly under `policy/`.

```text
policy/
  typescript/
    bundle.json
    files/
      linter.json
  conventions/
    bundle.json
    files/
      CONTRIBUTING.md
```

Commit declarations and native UTF-8 files, then consume the repository:

```sh
npx --yes 'ItsEthanDev/its-checks' add YOUR-USERNAME/policies
```

Policy updates become available through the explicit `update` operation. Uncommitted edits and CLI upgrades do not change pinned policy content.

## Declare bundles and dependencies

The [bundle schema](../schemas/bundle.schema.json) describes declaration fields. Each directory name is a stable lowercase hyphenated bundle ID. `name` and `description` are required display metadata. A directory rename changes identity. There is no root manifest or privileged baseline/category.

```json
{
  "name": "Project conventions",
  "description": "Starter contributor guidance and shared checks.",
  "requires": ["typescript"],
  "files": [
    {
      "source": "files/CONTRIBUTING.md",
      "target": "CONTRIBUTING.md",
      "operation": "seed"
    }
  ]
}
```

`requires` contains IDs from the same source revision, not repository references. Selecting a bundle includes transitive requirements. Missing bundles and cycles fail planning. Set `hidden: true` for dependency-only bundles; they cannot be explicitly selected but appear with dependency explanations in the plan.

Bundles install policy tooling, not application libraries, frameworks, or compilers. Leave those prerequisites to the project. Extract shared bundles only for genuinely shared contributions.

Bundle directories contain only `bundle.json` and `files/`. No executable installers, symlinks, or code evaluation are supported. Package scripts are declared contributions and may execute later through the project's normal package-manager lifecycle; disclose their purpose in the bundle description.

### Completion notes

Declare an optional `note` in `bundle.json` for follow-up guidance:

```json
{
  "name": "Project conventions",
  "description": "Starter contributor guidance.",
  "note": "**NEXT STEP**\n\nReview CONTRIBUTING.md and fill in the project-specific guidance."
}
```

After successful application, the CLI displays each selected bundle's note in a box titled with its name, after the completion summary. Required bundles' notes are included. Notes repeat on successful reruns, even when no configuration changes; write them so they remain accurate after the suggested work is done. Failed or declined applications do not emit completion notes.

Notes support newlines and `**bold emphasis**`, not general Markdown. The CLI controls title colors and strips terminal escape sequences for display. Without color, the boxes and text remain readable. Notes are informational text, not executable hooks. Saved plans capture them; JSON application results expose them as `notes` entries containing `bundle` (the source-qualified key), `name`, and the original `message` text.

## Declare file ownership

Every file contribution declares `source`, `target`, and `operation`:

| Operation | Application                                        | Deselection or source removal                                   |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `seed`    | Create only if absent; preserve existing bytes     | Leave behind as project-owned content                           |
| `replace` | Write the complete declared file                   | Propose deleting it if no selected bundle supplies it           |
| `compose` | Combine declared JSON fields using the rules below | Remove managed contributions; leave seeded and unrelated fields |

`source` must be under the bundle's `files/`; `target` is relative to the target project. Paths must not escape the project or traverse `.git`, `node_modules`, or symlinks. Root `package.json` and `.its-checks.json` use dedicated contracts and cannot be file targets. Set `executable: true` when the output needs executable permissions; source-file mode is not an ownership declaration.

For typed inputs or composition, declare `format: "json"` or `"jsonc"`. Composition requires an object document. Seed/replace can write other UTF-8 formats, including Markdown, YAML, shell hooks, and extensionless files. The CLI does not infer behavior from filenames.

Replace overwrites edits within its managed scope. Compose declares ownership per field. No output baseline or edit tracking is required. Use seed for documents intentionally handed off to the project. In particular, a project-owned module index should be seeded rather than replaced.

### JSON composition

Object keys combine recursively. Scalars are atomic; arrays are atomic unless a merge or indexed field is explicitly declared. Identical values with matching ownership and merge settings coalesce; incompatible contributions fail. There is no implicit array concatenation or source-order winner.

`defaultMode` sets ownership for contributed fields and defaults to `replace`. Every `fields` entry is an object keyed by a JSON Pointer. `mode` applies to the contributed subtree, and more-specific modes take precedence. A parent setting does not claim unrelated project fields. Pointers must exist in the contribution and can traverse object keys and zero-based array indexes. Array indexes use decimal digits without leading zeros. Escape `/` as `~1` and `~` as `~0`.

| Field mode | Application                                                                                             | Updates and removal                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `seed`     | Set only if the key is absent; preserve any existing value, including `false`, `null`, and empty values | Project-owned once present; do not update or remove it |
| `replace`  | Enforce the declared value within its scope                                                             | Update managed values and remove prior contributions   |

This example supplies overridable defaults except for one enforced rule:

```json
{
  "source": "files/linter.json",
  "target": ".linter.json",
  "operation": "compose",
  "format": "json",
  "defaultMode": "seed",
  "fields": {
    "/rules/example~1rule": { "mode": "replace" }
  }
}
```

Changing a managed field to `seed` preserves the current project value rather than deleting and reseeding it. Seeded defaults never update automatically. If a contributed child needs an object or array parent but the project has an incompatible value there, planning fails instead of overwriting the parent.

### Array merging

Declare array behavior in the same field object:

```json
{
  "source": "files/linter.json",
  "target": ".linter.json",
  "operation": "compose",
  "format": "json",
  "defaultMode": "seed",
  "fields": {
    "/ignorePatterns": {
      "mode": "replace",
      "merge": "append-unique"
    }
  }
}
```

`append-unique` requires `replace` mode, whether explicit or inherited. It makes the bundle's array items the managed scope, not the whole array. Unrelated project items remain; policy updates remove prior contributed items and append current items. Existing non-array project values cause a conflict.

Items append in deterministic dependency-first, then source-qualified lexical bundle order, removing exact duplicates. Bundles contributing to the same array must declare the same merge and mode. Bundles contributing only other fields do not repeat that declaration.

Arrays are atomic unless a merge is declared on the array or a field is declared inside it. A pointer through an array makes that array compose by fixed position, not concatenation. Contributions must have matching lengths, and shared values at each position must be compatible. Existing non-array project values cause a conflict. Undeclared nested arrays remain atomic. Do not declare indexed fields inside an `append-unique` array: its item positions change during composition.

For example, combine a rule's allowlists without concatenating its severity/options tuple. Each contributing bundle declares:

```json
"fields": {
  "/rules/example/1/allow": { "merge": "append-unique" }
}
```

Its native configuration supplies:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "example": ["error", { "allow": ["externalName"] }]
  }
}
```

Another bundle can contribute different allowed names with the same declaration and severity. Project-added names and unrelated options remain intact. Updates and removal subtract managed names without shifting tuple positions; positions needed to retain remaining content keep their existing surrounding values.

Prior pinned declarations and saved answers identify managed fields and array items to remove before recomposition. This is not a historical output baseline: direct edits to managed fields may be removed, while seeded and unrelated fields/items remain. JSON comments and formatting are not preserved when composition changes values.

### Explicit field replacement

For intentional incompatible values or ownership modes, a composing bundle can replace a selected ordinary contribution from the same source:

```json
{
  "source": "files/linter.json",
  "target": ".linter.json",
  "operation": "compose",
  "format": "json",
  "fields": {
    "/rules/example~1rule": {
      "mode": "replace",
      "replaces": "typescript"
    }
  }
}
```

The pointer must exist in both contributions. Replacement supersedes the target's value, ownership mode, and merge settings at that subtree. A `replace` contribution can explicitly supersede a `seed`; it does not win automatically. Even identical values conflict if their ownership modes differ without explicit replacement.

The target is a stable source-local bundle ID, not display text. Require the target bundle when the replacement relies on it. Cross-source replacement and replacement chains are unsupported; incompatible replacements of the same field conflict. Removing the replacement restores the target's declaration, not a historical project value. If the restored declaration is a seed, the current project value remains. Other sources still participate in conflict checks.

Overlapping complete-file operations must be compatible and identical, including seeds even when the target already exists. Different operations, composition declarations, case aliases, and file/directory destination overlaps fail before application.

## Contribute dependencies and scripts

Use `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and `scripts` in `bundle.json`, not a complete package manifest. Unrelated package fields and scripts remain intact. Identical dependency requirements coalesce; different strings fail without version-range resolution. If the same requirement appears in both dependency sections across bundles, the production section wins. These rules govern bundle contributions; existing project values at contributed package keys are replaced through the reviewed plan.

A script string contributes a command. Commands run in deterministic dependency-first order, with unrelated bundles ordered by source-qualified ID; exact duplicates coalesce. Existing project commands run before policy commands. Generated `its-checks:<script>` helpers and recognizable public wrappers let reruns replace policy commands without tracking their previous contents. That helper namespace is reserved. Edited wrappers that cannot be recognized fail rather than trigger a shell rewrite.

Replace one source-local bundle's ordinary command without adding a second pass:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": {
      "command": "alternate-linter .",
      "replaces": "typescript"
    }
  }
}
```

The selected target must supply an ordinary string for that script. Replacement keeps its target's position; chains and cross-source replacements are unsupported. Identical replacements coalesce, conflicting replacements fail, and deselection restores the target command. Other bundles' commands and unrelated project scripts remain intact. Scripts require POSIX `/bin/sh`.

## Declare typed inputs

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "stylesheet",
      "prompt": "Stylesheet path?",
      "type": "path",
      "default": "src/styles.css",
      "destination": {
        "file": ".linter.json",
        "field": ["settings", "stylesheet"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Types are `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and `path`. Paths are safe project-relative POSIX paths; existence is not required. Destinations must already exist in this bundle's declared JSON/JSONC contribution; the declared format, not the filename, determines eligibility. Loading selected bundles validates destination fields and rejects overlaps before input enumeration or answer binding. Field paths use object keys and nonnegative array indexes. Discovery reads declarations only, not native file content.

Answers are scoped by repository, bundle ID, and input ID. Interactive mode offers valid saved answers or defaults; headless callers supply explicit answers even when defaults exist. Do not request secrets: answers are saved and appear in plans. Global inputs and cross-bundle answer references are unsupported.
